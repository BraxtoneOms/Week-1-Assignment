    <h2>Summary</h2>
    <section id = "Summary">
        <article>
            <p>
            In a sweeping enforcement action this past week, the U.S. Federal Trade Commission (FTC) 
            escalated scrutiny of companies using "Made in the USA" claims. Under the 2021 MUSA Labeling Rule, 
            such claims may now trigger fines of up to <strong>$53,088 per violation</strong> if products do not meet the "all 
            or virtually all" domestic origin standard. That means final assembly, processing, and all significant 
            components must originate in the U.S. <br>

            The FTC issued formal warning letters to makers across multiple sectors including flagpoles, 
            footwear brands, and personal care products citing possible deceptive marketing practices under 
            both the FTC Act and labeling regulations. The agency’s definition of "label" now explicitly includes 
            online marketing and images, significantly broadening enforcement reach.<br>

            At the same time, private litigants and self-regulatory bodies have intensified legal challenges. 
            Class-action lawsuits addressing misleading "Made in USA" claims doubled in 2025, with several 
            high-profile cases in California invoking state vs federal labeling law disputes. 
            The National Advertising Division (NAD) has also issued decisions against companies overstating 
            domestic content.<br>

    <h2>Why It Matters</h2>
        <ol>
            <li> <strong>Risk of heavy penalties: </strong>Companies face both federal enforcement and private lawsuits. </li>
            <li> <strong>Compliance complexity:</strong> Firms must audit supply chains to ensure genuine U.S. sourcing.</li>
            <li> <strong>Marketing vigilance:</strong> Claims, including those made online must truthfully reflect product origins.</li>

        </ol>

    <h2> What businesses should do:</h2>
        <ol>
            <li> Review supply chain documentation to confirm “Made in USA” eligibility.</li>
            <li> Update marketing materials—including digital and packaging labels to comply.</li>
            <li> Consult legal or regulatory experts, especially if under scrutiny or litigation.</li>
        </ol>
        <p> As scrutiny around domestic origin claims grows, companies claiming U.S. manufacturing 
            credentials are urged to dial in accuracy missteps may prove costly both legally and reputationally.</p>
